So here goes nothing I guess. Got the site up and running based on a couple different tutorials that I followed pretty closely. I still feel like I know next to nothing about what I'm doing on here even though I should certainly know better.
What little I learned in school working on github and such seems to not have found a very solid plot of soil in my mind and what little growth was seen must now be repeated. Hopefully this time it's roots find more of a place. This shit is confusing
as hell man hahaha, and I feel like a simpleton trying to absorb it all. Bit by bit I suppose. Rome wasn't built in a day
